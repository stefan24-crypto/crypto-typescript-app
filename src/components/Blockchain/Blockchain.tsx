            Blockchain technology might be one of the most-hyped innovations of
            the 21st century. A blockchain is a public digital ledger of
            transactions maintained by a network of computers in a way that
            makes it difficult to have or alter. The technology offers a secure
            way for individuals to deal directly with each other without outside
            interference such as the government.

            <br />
            The growing list of records, called blocks, is linked together using
            cryptography. Each transaction is independently verified by
            peer-toâ€“peer computer networks, time-stamped and added to a growing
            chain of data. Once recorded it cannot be altered.

            <p>
              Using Bitcoin as an example, the purchase and sale of bitcoin is
              entered and transmitted to a network of powerful computers, known
              as nodes.

              <h3>Step 2</h3>

            <p>
              This network of thousands of nodes around the world views to
              confirm the transaction using computer algorithms. This is known
              as bitcoin mining, The miner who first successfully completes a
              new block is rewarded with bitcoin for their work.

            </header>
            <p>
              After the purchase is cryptographically confirmed, the sale is
              added to a block on the distributed ledger, The majority of the
              network must then confirm the sale.

            <p>
              The block is permanently chained to all previous blocks of bitcoin
              transactions, using a cryptographic fingerprint known as a hash,
              and the sale is processed.
